Tensor Calculus in Exact Real Computation

Exact Real Computation is a new paradigm for reliable numerics and rapid numerical prototyping.
By object-oriented overloading, a new abstract data type REAL takes care of all the hassles 
of classical floating-point arithmetic like rounding errors and cancellation.
It has been implemented in the C++ library iRRAM [1].

This project evolves around implementing, empirically evaluating and assessing the practical performance
of some of the algorithm that we and others have devised, analyzed, and proven efficient theoretically.

* This project is closely connect to current research pursued in our lab:
* Details and the exact goals are open for discussion with the project team, but 
* candidates are required to exhibit a solid background in mathematical analysis 
  and be fluent in C++.
* For some introductory reading, refer to [2,3,4] below;
  further background will be provided via a tutorial seminar.
* Conversely, the project team is expected to give an initial 
  and a concluding presentation in our lab seminar.
* You will enjoy close supervision and advice in regular lab meetings.
